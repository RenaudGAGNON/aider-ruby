# Coverage Report - AiderRuby

## Summary

- **Initial Coverage**: 51.18% (435/850 LOC)
- **Final Coverage**: 85.41% (726/850 LOC)
- **Improvement**: +34.23% (291 additional lines covered)
- **Total Tests**: 164 examples
- **Failures**: 0

## Test Files

### 1. spec/aider_ruby_spec.rb (117 tests)
Tests for core functionality:
- Main AiderRuby module
- Configuration class
- Client class (basic methods)
- Models module
- TaskExecutor class
- Validation module (all validators)
- ErrorHandling module (all error types)

### 2. spec/client_execution_spec.rb (47 tests)
Additional tests for:
- Client execution methods
- Folder operations (add_folder, add_read_only_folder)
- Advanced configuration methods
- Task executor execution methods (coding, refactoring, debugging, documentation, test generation, multi-step)
- Edge cases and error handling

## Coverage by Module

### High Coverage Areas (>90%)
- ✅ **Validation Module**: All validators tested
- ✅ **ErrorHandling Module**: All error handlers tested
- ✅ **Models Module**: All methods tested
- ✅ **Config Module**: Configuration management fully covered

### Good Coverage Areas (70-90%)
- ✅ **Client Module**: Core functionality well tested
- ✅ **TaskExecutor Module**: Main execution paths covered

### Areas Not Covered (typically execution-dependent code)
The remaining ~15% uncovered lines are primarily:
- Actual command execution (requires aider binary)
- Interactive mode (requires user input)
- Some error paths that require specific runtime conditions
- Private helper methods in execution context

## Test Quality

All tests follow best practices:
- Use of temporary files for file operations
- Proper cleanup (file unlinking)
- Mocking for execution tests
- Edge case testing
- Error path testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run with coverage report
bundle exec rspec --format documentation

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

## Next Steps

To achieve higher coverage (>90%), consider:
1. Adding integration tests with mocked aider execution
2. Testing interactive mode with simulated input
3. Testing rare error conditions
4. Adding tests for remaining edge cases in Config#to_aider_args
